Intentional emission of semen, except while dreaming, entails initial and

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>2.</span></b><span lang=EN-US> Should
any bhikkhu, overcome by lust, with altered mind, engage in bodily contact with
a woman, or in holding her hand, holding a lock of her hair, or caressing any
of her limbs, it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.</span></p>

in the manner of young men to a young woman alluding to sexual intercourse, it
entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>4.</span></b><span lang=EN-US> Should

woman in praise of ministering to his own sensuality thus: “This, sister, is
the foremost ministration, that of ministering to a virtuous, fine-natured

sexual intercourse — it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the

any bhikkhu engage in conveying a man’s intentions to a woman or a woman’s
intentions to a man, proposing marriage or paramourage — even if only for a
momentary liaison — it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the
Community.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>6.</span></b><span lang=EN-US> When a
bhikkhu is having a hut built from (gains acquired by) his own begging — having
no sponsor and destined for himself — he is to have it built to the standard
measurement. Here the standard is this: twelve spans, using the sugata span, in
length (measuring outside); seven in width, (measuring) inside. Bhikkhus are to
be assembled to designate the site. The site the bhikkhus designate should be
without disturbances and with adequate space. If the bhikkhu should have a hut built
from his own begging on a site with disturbances and without adequate space, or
if he should not assemble the bhikkhus to designate the site, or if he should
have the standard exceeded, it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the

bhikkhus designate should be without disturbances and with adequate space. If
the bhikkhu should have a large dwelling built on a site with disturbances and
without adequate space, or if he should not assemble the bhikkhus to designate
the site, it entails initial and subsequent meetings of the Community.</span></p>

unfounded case entailing defeat, (thinking), “Perhaps I may bring about his
fall from this celibate life,” then regardless of whether or not he is
cross-examined on a later occasion, if the issue is unfounded and the bhikkhu

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>9.</span></b><span lang=EN-US> Should

“Do not, venerable sir, agitate for a schism in a united Community or persist
in taking up an issue conducive to schism. Let the venerable one be reconciled
with the Community, for a united Community, on courteous terms, without

<p class=MsoNormal><span lang=EN-US>Rules for settling disputes</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>1.</span></b><span lang=EN-US> <i>A
verdict “in the presence of” should be given.</i> This means that the formal
act settling the issue must be carried out in the presence of the Community, in
the presence of the individuals, and in the presence of the Dhamma and Vinaya.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>2.</span></b><span lang=EN-US> <i>A
verdict of mindfulness may be given.</i> This is the verdict of innocence given
in an accusation, based on the fact that the accused remembers fully that he
did not commit the offense in question.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>3.</span></b><span lang=EN-US> <i>A
verdict of past insanity may be given.</i> This is another verdict of innocence
given in an accusation, based on the fact that the accused was out of his mind
when he committed the offense in question and so is absolved of any
responsibility for it.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>4.</span></b><span lang=EN-US> <i>Acting
in accordance with what is admitted.</i> This refers to the ordinary confession
of offenses, where no formal interrogation is involved. The confession is valid
only if in accord with the facts, e.g., a bhikkhu actually commits a p</span><span
lang=EN-US style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>ā</span><span
lang=EN-US>cittiya offense and then confesses it as such, and not as a stronger
or lesser offense. If he were to confess it as a dukkata or a sa</span><span
lang=EN-US style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>ṅ</span><span
lang=EN-US>gh</span><span lang=EN-US style='mso-fareast-font-family:"Arial Unicode MS"'>ā</span><span
lang=EN-US>disesa, that would be invalid.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>5.</span></b><span lang=EN-US> <i>Acting
in accordance with the majority.</i> This refers to cases in which bhikkhus are
unable to settle a dispute unanimously, even after all the proper procedures
are followed, and — in the words of the Canon — are “wounding one another with
weapons of the tongue.” In cases such as these, decisions can be made by
majority vote.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>6.</span></b><span lang=EN-US> <i>Acting
for his (the accused’s) further punishment.</i> This refers to cases where a
bhikkhu admits to having committed the offense in question only after being
formally interrogated about it. He is then to be reproved for his actions, made
to remember the offense, and to confess it. After that the Community imposes
the further punishment of a Community transaction that requires him to forfeit
a long list of his normal rights as a bhikkhu for a period of time until they
are satisfied that he has taken the lesson to heart.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span lang=EN-US>7.</span></b><span lang=EN-US> <i>Covering
over as with grass.</i> This refers to situations in which both sides of a
dispute realize that, in the course of their dispute, they have done much that
is unworthy of a contemplative. If they were to deal with one another for their
offenses, the only result would be greater divisiveness. Thus if both sides agree,
all the bhikkhus gather in one place. (According to the Commentary, this means
that all bhikkhus in the <i>sima</i> must attend. No one should send his
consent, and even sick bhikkhus must go.) A motion is made to the entire group
that this procedure will be followed. One member of each side then makes a
formal motion to the members of his faction that he will make a confession for
them. When both sides are ready, the representative of each side addresses the
entire group and makes the blanket confession, using the form of a motion and
one announcement (<i>natti-dutiya-kamma</i>).</span></p>
